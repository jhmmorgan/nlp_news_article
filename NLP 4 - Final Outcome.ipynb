    "\n",
    "We want a proof of concept, where an end user can easily be provided with a summary of a news article, along with a warning on whether the text is likely to contain hate speech or fake news.\n",
    "\n",
    "This proof of concept would be in the form of a standalone application that when provided the URL to a news article, provides the end-user with the summary of the article, along with a flag if the article may contain hate speech or fake news.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Task\n",
    "This notebook is **Part 3** of my NLP project. The task of this notebook is to scrape the relevant text from a provided URL.  This text can then be processed by our various NLP models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# üî¨ Approach\n",
    "This is a fairly easy task, thanks to the amazing library **BeautifulSoup**.  Extracting raw text from any URL is fairly simple with only a few lines of code, however configuation is needed to scrape just the relevant parts of that text.\n",
    "\n",

    "# üìö Libraries and functions\n",
    "We'll start by loading the libraries and then loading in the example data containing various articles of text."

    "The models aren't perfect.  \n",
    "1. We could train our fake news and hate speech models in a more shopisticated way\n",
    "    - There's no training around the source of articles\n",
    "    - There's no training around key hate words\n",
    "    - There's no understanding of context, which could turn any normal phrase into hate news when used in certain ways.\n",
    "2. The summarisation technique is simple but effective and it'll take significantly more effort to create an abstrative summarisation technique.\n",
    "3. The news article scraper is good, however for the proof of concept we've taken a manual approach of extracting text.\n",
    "     - We could use third-party libraries, or train a model to identify key tags to extract text from\n",
    "4. Our predictions aren't perfect.\n",
    "    - We trained our models on limited data\n",
    "    - The hate speech model was based on tweets, which contain a lot fewer words than a news article, which likely impacts the performance\n",
    "    - So whilst our models perform great on their trained data, this may not translate perfectly to articles of text of different sizes or of different context.\n",
